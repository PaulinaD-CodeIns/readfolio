      <p>
        Once upon a time, a quiet bookworm got tired of forgetting what she read, what she loved, and how it all made her feel. That’s me. 🙋‍♀️
        I grew up scribbling thoughts in the margins of novels and then... losing them. Books came and went, but my reflections? Vanished like plot twists.

        Enter <strong>ReadFolio</strong> — your digital bookshelf meets journal. Here, you can track what you're reading, what you've finished, and what you want to dive into next. But more than that, it’s a space to leave a mark on the books that left a mark on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write honest reviews — private if they’re just for you, public if you're feeling generous. No stars needed to be a guiding light for others. Whether your take is glowing, grumpy, or gloriously in-between, it's yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of ReadFolio as your own library of lived-through literature — where every finished book becomes a bookmark in your personal story.
      </p>
      <p class="fst-italic text-end mt-4">So don’t get lost in the pages — let ReadFolio be your map. 📖💜</p>
